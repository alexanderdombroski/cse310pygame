# Overview

This is a pygame project developed in python 3.12. It's a simple dungeon crawler with rooms and interactable elements. The player wins the game by completing rooms and earning trophies.

We chose this project because all of us wanted to get better at creating and implementing Python classes. We are also learning to collaborate through Git.

# Future Work

* Add rewards for collecting coins. Right now the coins are collectable but have no purpose.
* Diversify our the rooms. Some of the rooms are too similar to each other and should be modified to make the game more interesting.
* Add more sprite images so that the player's sprite can be facing different directions depending on the direction of movement.
